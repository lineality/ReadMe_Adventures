Scene 1: Find Your Friends


Instructions:
1. Open Terminal
2. Get file       wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lineality/ReadMe_Adventures/master/Learn_NLP__Dungeon_of_Scrolls/scene_01/scene_01.py
3. Run file       Command: python3 scene_1.py



Tips:

1. Content Map
If you get lost, or you want to see a discussion of the skills 
and solutions, check the Content_Map.txt for that scene.
(Content_Map.txt will be generated when .py is run)

2. When given a choice or a question,
type in your answer and hit return.

3. Running the .py file will
run the interactive story in the terminal
and will create new files
that you can use during the scene.
Look for these folders and files
in the directory (folder) that your command terminal is open in.
(This file may be updated as well.)

3. (quasi spoiler)
Since it is lying on the bar-counter in front of you,
you can 'access' the inn's guest-register.
Check your file directory again.
(This will help you to answer
the red-nosed innkeeper's question.)
