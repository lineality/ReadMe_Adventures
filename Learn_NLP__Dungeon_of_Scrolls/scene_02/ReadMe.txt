Instructions:
1. Open Terminal
2. Get file       wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lineality/ReadMe_Adventures/master/Learn_NLP__Dungeon_of_Scrolls/scene_02/scene_02.py
3. Run file       Command: python3 scene_2.py


Tips:

1. Content Map
If you get lost, or you want to see a discussion of the skills 
and solutions, check the Content_Map.txt for that scene.
(Content_Map.txt will be generated when .py is run)

2. Steps to check the length of two files in python:
  1. open python:
     $ python3

  2. load both files as different variables 
     (just like loading for printing in the last scene)
     
  3. check the lenth with len() e.g. print( len(x) )
